// learning about variables

// There are 3 types of variables in javascript. They are as follows 

var // Before 2015 var was the only way to define a variable. The problem with var was that variable declaring var could be reassigned with another variable thus making it harder for debugging.
let 
///const
var a = "Rahul"
var a = "Hemango"
console.log(a)
const b = "CHERRY"
console.log(b)


document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML=a
